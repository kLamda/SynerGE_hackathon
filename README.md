# SynerGE_hackathon
An automated web app to scrap tendor datas from website and filter the obtained data and a DL model to train on the filtered data and predict the most likely medical requirement at different states. The whole tendor scrapping updates the collected data over 24 hrs automatically and re-trains the DL model to remain updated for any variance.
